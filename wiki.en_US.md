# Advanced Configuration

## Sonarr

### qBittorrent

> üåü Proxy qBittorrent is able to format the titles that qBittorrent transmits to Sonarr when the download is complete, reducing the chance of importing the wrong season

‚ë† Fill in the `Server Url` of qBittorrent, after saving, it should be as shown in the picture ‚úÖ , otherwise please check the input and network connectivity

![20230406182922](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406182922.webp)

‚ë° Modify the `Host` and `Port` of the downloader in Sonarr to the `IP` and `Port` of JProxy, and append `/sonarr/qbittorrent` to `Url Base`

`Empty` ‚û°Ô∏è `/sonarr/qbittorrent`

`/qbittorrent` ‚û°Ô∏è `/sonarr/qbittorrent/qbittorrent`

![20230405203518](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-05/20230405203518.webp)

üö® If you have `Remote Path Mappings`Ôºådo not forget modify the `Host` to the `IP` of JProxy

![20230405203612](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-05/20230405203612.webp)

### TMDB

> üåü Synchronize the TMDB title, which can be used to add the title of the primary language and the secondary language when searching, and can also be used to match the title of the result to improve the recognition rate

‚ë† If you do not have a TMDB account, please [register an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) first, then [obtain an API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api), after saving, it should normally be as shown in the picture ‚úÖ, otherwise please check the input and network connectivity

![20230405203809](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-05/20230405203809.webp)
![20230406184917](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406184917.webp)

‚ë° For the first use, it is recommended to manually synchronize the data once (it will be automatically synchronized later)

![20230406184943](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406184943.webp)

## Radarr

‚ë† Fill in the Radarr `Server Url` and `API KEY` in `System - Configure`, after saving, it should normally be as shown in the picture ‚úÖ, otherwise please check the input and network connectivity

![20230406185218](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185218.webp)
![20230406185313](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185313.webp)

‚ë° For the first use, it is recommended to manually synchronize `Movie Title` and `Movie Rule` once (it will be automatically synchronized later)

![20230406185347](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185347.webp)
![20230406185409](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185409.webp)

‚ë¢ In `Radarr - Settings - Indexer`, modify the `IP` and `Port` of `URL` of the indexer to the `IP` and `Port` of JProxy, and append the path `/radarr/jackett` (Prowlarr should append with `/radarr/prowlarr`)

`http://192.168.6.15:9117/api/v2.0/......` ‚û°Ô∏è `http://192.168.6.14:8117/radarr/jackett/api/v2.0/......`

![20230406185508](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185508.webp)

üí° It is recommended to modify one first, and then modify other indexer configurations after confirming that it is normal

![20230406185100](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185100.webp)

üí° When the Radarr quality language is configured as the main language, Radarr itself will automatically append the language title to the search, but at the same time, if the search result does not match the language, it will be rejected, so it is recommended

- `Anime` quality language is configured as the main language, because Radarr itself adds the main language query is more perfect, and `Anime` generally restricts the result language to the main language
- `Other` quality language is configured as Any, and JProxy will automatically append the main language title to query to avoid being rejected by Radarr because of the language

![20230406185555](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406185555.webp)

## Clean Title Regex

It is used to remove special characters in the title and improve the success rate of title matching (after updating, you need to manually synchronize the title or wait for the automatic update at regular intervals)

![20230406191734](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406191734.webp)
![20230406191818](https://github.com/LuckyPuppy514/image/raw/main/2023/2023-04-06/20230406191818.webp)

# Usage

## Cache

Used to clear the redis cache

- When the Series Title, TMDB Title or Movie Title synchronization prompt is too frequent, you can try to clear their cache and try again
- When the Configuration, Series Rule or Movie Rule are updated, but it does not take effect, you can try to clear their cache or all caches and try again
